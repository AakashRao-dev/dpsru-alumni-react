# DIPSAR Alumni Web App using React

> This is the React version of the Alumni website. I'm gonna tranform it into Next.js app after I get some time for building it for having a better SEO and performance.

## Technogies used to build this app

- React
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion
- React-wrapper (For Google Maps)
- Stripe API (For Payments)
- React-Hook-form (For Form Validations)

## For Increasing SEO for now:

- **Using Server-side rendering**: By rendering the initial state of the app on the server, search engines will be able to index the content of the app.

- **Metadata**: Need to include meta tags such as **title**, **description**, and **keywords** in the head of the HTML document. These tags provide important information to search engines about the content of the page.

- **Sitemap**: A sitemap that lists all of the pages of the app and submit it to Google Search Console.

- **Social media metadata**: Including open graph and twitter card tags to provide metadata for social media sharing.

- **Use Headless CMS**: Using a headless CMS to store and manage the content of the app, which will allow for more efficient and effective management of the app's content.

- **Using React Helmet**: A library that allows managing the head of the document, it will help us to add, update or manage the metadata of the document.

- **Using SEO-friendly URLs**: Use URLs that are easy to read and understand for both users and search engines.

- **Optimizing images**: Optimize images to reduce the file size and improve loading speed.

- **Continuous Tracking and monitoring**: Use tools like Google Analytics, Google Search Console and other analytics tools to track and monitor the performance of the app in search results.
